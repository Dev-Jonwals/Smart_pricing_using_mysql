#  Smart Pricing Optimization Tool (SQL + Tableau)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing discount strategies in a quick commerce environment using transaction-level data.  
The goal is to identify opportunities to **reduce unnecessary discounts**, **improve margins**, and **apply targeted promotions** based on customer behavior.

The project simulates a real-world pricing analytics workflow used by quick commerce companies like Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart.

This project answers:
- Where are we over-discounting?
- Which departments drive margin leakage?
- Which customer segments actually need discounts?
